
               SWEEP.EXE      Version 1.62  19Sep90
           --------------------------------------------

Sweep is a DOS (version 3.0 or later) command that allows you to "sweep"
commands down through several levels of directories.  It normally begins by
executing your commands in the current directory of the current drive, then
descends into any subdirectories of the current directory, if any.

Sweep continues until it has executed your commands in any directory that can
be reached from the current directory.  If executed from the root directory,
your command will be executed in all directories on the current drive.

Unlike the original sweep.com ( author unknown ), sweep.exe allows you to
pause or abort at any point, allows you to execute multiple commands in
each directory, allows you to force the sweep to begin at the root directory,
and/or allows you to NOT execute the commands in the current directory if you
desire not to.


USAGE
-----

SWEEP [-flags] command [;command ; command ; ...]


FLAGS:
------

   -c Do not execute commands in [c]urrent directory.

   -i [i]gnore keyboard - no pause command.

   -r Force sweep from [r]oot directory regardless of current directory

   -s Silent operation - do not echo command line to be executed

   -f File mode.  Don't execute commands, place them into a batch file
      called sweepb.bat.  The file will be created in the directory that
      was the current directory at the time sweep was invoked.

Combining -r and -c will cause the specified commands to not be executed
in the root directory, because the root directory is forced to be the 
current directory during the sweep.

Note: it important that command flags occur immediately after the SWEEP
command, otherwise they will be interpreted as part of some command to be
executed.  The command "sweep dir -r *.*" would execute "dir -r *.*" in
each directory, rather than beginning at the root directory if that was 
what was intended. 

Also, it is important that redirection to a file with the '>' or '>>'
redirection operators be enclosed in quotes; otherwise, the operating
system will cause the output redirection to apply to the entire operation
of the sweep command, rather than redirecting the output of your specified
command.  There is a MAJOR difference between the execution of:

       sweep dir >dir.lst

and the execution of:

       sweep dir ">dir.lst"


MULTIPLE COMMANDS
-----------------

Multiple commands can be executed in each directory that sweep visits, just
use a semicolor (;) to separate each command.



PAUSING SWEEP
-------------

   As long as the -i (ignore keyboard input) flag has not been specified,
sweep will constantly monitor the keyboard between execution of each command.
If it detects that a key has been pressed, a window will appear on the screen
asking you to press "A" to abort the sweep, or any other key to continue on
with execution of commands.  Since sweep is not in control of the system when
actually executing commands, the pause does not take effect until after the
current command has finished execution.
  

SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN COMMANDS
------------------------------

 & - replace with current path
 # - replace with current directory name
 ~ - abort any following commands if no file in this directory has
     been modified today

The characters # and & are considered to be special when encountered in a
command.  They are replaced, as describe below, prior to executing a command.

The & character is replaced by the full path name of the directory currently
being "swept", with a leading '\', but minus any drive specifier. (i.e. the
& character in a command while sweeping the directory "c:\123\wrksht\new"
would be replaced by "\123\wrksheet\new").

The # character is replaced by the directory name that sweep is currently
visiting.  When visiting the directory "c:\123\wrksheet\new", the # character
would be replaced by "new".

The # and & characters assume that you have a rational directory structure
naming convention in use on your hard disk.  If you tend to create directory
names like "###&&&#.&&&", then you had better not try using these replacement
characters during a sweep.


The ~ character instructs sweep to NOT perform any more commands in this 
directory unless at least one file in the directory has been modified today.
("today" meaning a file has a modification date that matches the current
system date).

   

EXAMPLES
--------

 sweep -irc del *.bak;del temp.*;dir *.c ">>c:\dir.lst"

   1.) sweep starting at the root directory (top level).
   2.) not execute any commands in the root directory.
   3.) not pause when a key was hit.
   4.) execute these three commands in all other directories:
           del *.bak
           del temp.*
           dir *.c >c:\dir.lst

 
To copy the entire directory structure of hard drive C: to hard drive D:,
use the following:

 c:
 sweep -rc md d:&


To copy every file in every directory except the root directory (assuming
there is enough room on the destination drive) use:

 sweep -rc md d:&;copy *.* d:&


To ZIP every file on a drive (DON'T try this on your hard drive unless you
have a copy of PKUNZIP on a floppy to UNZIP everything later) use:

 sweep -i pkzip -m # *.*


To back up all files that you have modified today (with "today" meaning the
file modification date matches the current system date setting) onto a floppy
in drive a: use:

 sweep ~;copy *.* a:



P. S.
-----

Sweep should be able to save you a few minutes of your time each time
you use it.  I use it to clean up .BAK files and temporary files after a
"hard day of editing", and also use to it backup files from my local drive
to my network at work.  If you do find SWEEP.EXE of some use or value,
please consider sending a minor contribution to the author (Nothing serious,
just $2 or $3 would be fine and keep me interested in upgrading it from
time to time).
