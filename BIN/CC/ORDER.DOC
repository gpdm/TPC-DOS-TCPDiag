REGISTRATION GUIDELINES ณ
ออออออออออออออออออออออออพ

  Controlled Copy is shareware. This means that you are entitled to try
  out this program for no charge. This does NOT mean that this program
  is free. If you decide to use CCopy after trying it for 30 days, you
  must register. For more information on the shareware concept, see the
  main documentation, CC.DOC.


WHY SHOULD I REGISTER? ณ
อออออออออออออออออออออออพ

  This is a very good question. After all, there is no possible way for
  me to make sure you do register. I personally like to believe in
  mankind and therefore I have not used any annoying nag-screens in the
  shareware-version. Whether you register or not is your own decision
  and I won't press you on that, but should you choose not to register,
  you aren't allowed to use CCopy after the 30 days of trial use. In
  this time you should be able to make up your mind. Here are some
  things that will become reality should you find this program of use.

  1. You will feel good about it. This is true. Using an illegal
     program can't possibly be very satisfying, but after registering
     you will have a clear conscience and your own personal copy of
     CCopy.

  2. You will support the shareware concept. This is very important.
     Only shareware programs allow you to test the software before
     paying for it and should this practice die, no one would benefit
     from it. And the only way that shareware programs can survive is
     that you, the user, support the idea and the authors behind the
     programs.

  3. You will support me. By registering I will know that another user
     has found my product worth a little investment. This will
     naturally encourage me to develop the program further and start
     new projects as well.

  And now the fun part...

  4. You will receive an activation code that will register any and all
     future versions of CCopy. Registered versions will have your name on
     them and have all the extended features enabled:
     - larger data buffers to increase copying speeds (Appendix A, CC.DOC)
     - instant pause with resume, skip and abort choices
     - optional event logging (for statistics and undo-operation)

  5. You will get free technical support indefinitely via e-mail, phone
     and normal mail.


HOW TO REGISTER? ณ
อออออออออออออออออพ

   Just execute the program REGISTER.EXE. You can then choose to register
   CCopy or upgrade from previous registrations (which did not have an
   activation code).

   If you have not registered CCopy before, choose the new registration.

   If, on the other hand, you have registered a previous version, select
   CCopy upgrade.  If you've registered 1.07, the registration costs a
   nominal fee of $5US. If you've registered a version older than 1.07 or
   the 1.07 six-pack, select the option [1] so you get a free upgrade.

   After you've selected the correct version, you can choose the amount of
   registrations. Normally you'll only select one registration.

   At this point, you will have to enter the registration information. First
   you're asked for the name that will be branded into the executable.
   Second, you'll be asked to enter your personal code. This code is used to
   make sure no-one else can use your registration.

   WHEN YOU GET YOUR REPLY CONTAINING THE ACTIVATION CODE, YOUR PERSONAL CODE
   IS NOT SENT WITH IT. THIS WILL PREVENT ANYONE ELSE FROM ABUSING YOUR
   ACTIVATION CODE.

     !!! PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR PERSONAL CODE IN A SAFE PLACE !!!

   After this, you have to enter your personal information and select the
   payment method. Then you can select how you want to send the information
   to Kagi, which handles CCopy registrations.

   NOTE! If you've selected a registration method that does not cost
   anything, you can send the information directly to me! In this case,
   you don't need to send the bar codes that are possibly generated. They are
   used to automate the process at Kagi, but are useless to me personally.
