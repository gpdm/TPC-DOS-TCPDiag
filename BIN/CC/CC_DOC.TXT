WHAT IS CCOPY? ณ
อออออออออออออออพ

  Controlled Copy is a file copier/mover for DOS, Windows, Windows 95 and
  OS/2.  It is easier to use than the conventional copier and also much
  faster.  It also has several advanced features active at all times that
  make file copying easier, safer and much more enjoyable.

  CCopy recognizes over 30 different command line options and is thus
  the most versatile file copier in existence. If you're familiar with
  4DOS(tm), you know what a difference it is to be able to enter
  several source masks to a copy-command. In addition, 4DOS has many
  other features that make DOS much easier to use. CCopy does
  everything that 4DOS's copy-command does and most of the time CCopy
  doesn't even require 4DOS to be active!

  CCopy will make life a lot easier for you. Automatic free space
  checking, added file protection and progress indicators will make
  copying chores simple and easy. With the numerous command line options
  CCopy can do just about anything, including file moving, comparing and
  splitting, subdirectory copying, program updating/downdating, sound
  alarms, file renaming and lots, lots more! The only way to believe it
  is to try it.

  To get the full benefit of all the advanced features CCopy can offer you,
  it is recommended that you read this entire documentation at least once
  through.  Especially the chapter "Tips and Techniques" is recommended,
  and "Command Line Options" also contains important information.



อออออออออออออออัอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
WHY USE CCOPY? ณ
อออออออออออออออพ

  There are several reasons for using CCopy exclusively. After you've
  learned to rely on the benefits CCopy can provide, normal copiers will
  simply seem inadequate for your purposes. Remember that with CCopy you
  can do some things that are simply *impossible* using any other copier!
  Some important facts are listed here.

  1. Automatic free space checking. CCopy always checks that the
     destination disk contains enough free space to complete the command
     it is given. Cluster sizes are taken into account and subst-commands
     are transparent. With CCopy, it's impossible to copy a file and
     run out of free space (unless you specifically disable free space
     checking).

  2. Progress indicators. CCopy always shows information on the screen,
     unless you want something else, of course. Each file is shown on its own
     line with its name, size, progress indicators and the estimated time
     left.

  3. Automatic disk change. If you've chosen to continue copying even
     if there isn't enough space for all files CCopy will pause when
     it has copied all it can and asks you to change the disk. You can
     then enter another disk to the drive and press any key to
     continue or alternatively skip the current file. It can't be much
     easier than this.

  4. Fast file transfer speeds. CCopy uses large data buffers to
     achieve maximum speed while copying files. With large files, CCopy
     is considerably faster and with small files as fast as the copy
     command. More detailed results are shown in Appendix A, "Speed
     Comparison".

  5. Security and protection. CCopy *never* overwrites another file
     before asking for permission, unless you specify otherwise in the
     command line. Overwriting read-only files requires another
     confirmation so CCopy is much safer to use than other copiers.

  6. Ease of use. Command line options can be entered with considerable
     freedom and source and destination masks are also parsed with a
     lot more thought than is usually the case. CCopy also has a
     feature called Automatic Subdirectory Creation. You can read more
     on this from the next chapter.

  7. Versatility. With CCopy you can easily accomplish complex things
     that would otherwise require batch files or even separate
     programs. Most things can be done with a normal copier but usually
     require dozens of separate copy commands with different
     parameters. And some are simply impossible to do. Examples can be
     found in the chapter "Tips and Techniques".



ออออออออออออออออออัออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
HOW TO USE CCOPY? ณ
ออออออออออออออออออพ

  Syntax: CC source1 [source2... destination] [options]

  Brackets mean optional entries. This may look cryptic but is actually
  the same syntax 4DOS's copy uses. What does this mean, then? You can
  run CCopy with just one argument which is the source mask. In this
  case the destination will be the current directory. If you specify
  more than one mask, then the last one will be used as the destination
  and all the others are source masks.

อออออออ

  Command line options can be entered *anywhere* in the command line. A
  command line option is always located between a slash (/) and a space
  ( ). You can enter several options together one after the other, but
  you must separate them from normal masks. These following examples
  are all identical to CCopy:

  CC *.ZIP A: /V- /P /R /4
  CC/p *.zip /v-4r A:
  CC *.zip /p4rv- a:

  As you can see, all options are case-insensitive. They can be entered
  one after the other. As long as the they are surrounded by spaces on
  both sides and have a slash in front of them they are considered to be
  command line options.

อออออออ

  You can always trim source and destination masks. When you want to
  copy all the files from some location, you would normally type "*.*"
  after the path. But not with CCopy! A simple dot (.) is the same
  thing as a dot means "current directory". In fact, you don't even
  need that dot. It's enough to specify the path and CCopy will do the
  rest.

  These two commands mean the same thing:
  CC *.* A:
  CC . A:

  These also mean the same thing:
  CC A:*.*
  CC A:.
  CC A:

  These also mean exactly the same thing:
  CC A:*.* D:\FILES\*.* .
  CC A:. D:\FILES\. .
  CC A: D:\FILES\ .
  CC A: D:\FILES .

  Notice the dot at the end of the command. The files from drive A: are
  not copied to D:\FILES but rather the files from A: and D:\FILES are
  copied to the current directory on the current drive.

อออออออ

  Another feature is directory backtracing that is also found in 4DOS.
  Normally two dots mean the parent directory. Now you can enter three
  dots to access the parent directory of the parent. And four dots
  refer to the next parent, etc. Here are some examples:

  C:\FILES> CC .. D:
  C:\FILES\NEW> CC ... D:
  C:\FILES\NEW\TODAY> CC .... D:
  C:\FILES\NEW\TODAY\UTILS> CC ..... D:

  All of these commands will copy the files from the root of C: to
  drive D:. This feature may be useful in certain situations.

อออออออ

  [y/N/a/s/r/?]
  This is part of a prompt you will see several times when using CCopy.
  It follows all confirmation prompts so you'd better know what the
  choices are.

  ?:        This will show the prompt in it's long format:
            (Y)es,(N)o,(A)ll,(S)kip all,(R)ename
  Yes:      This will accept the file and copy/move it.
  No:       This will skip the file and proceed to the next file.
  All:      This will accept the file and all other files that follow.
  Skip all: This will skip the file and all other files that follow.
  Rename:   This will allow you to edit the file's destination name.

  Notice that answering a certain prompt, for example one about overwriting
  another file, only affects similar situations later on. So if you answer
  "Skip all", further files are still copied as long as they don't
  overwrite other files.

อออออออ

  CCopy recognizes the environment variable CCOPY and will read its
  contents before the command line is processed. You can thus easily
  specify your favourite options in there and don't have to worry about
  remembering to add them to every command you make.

  As the variable is handled before the actual command line, you can
  always disable any options in the command line in case you don't want
  to use them in a certain situation.

อออออออ

  CCOPY CON: The console interface is improved over the conventional
  copier, and now you can enter ANY characters to the file - using
  ALT-keypad, CTRL-letters or normal characters or even ESC, backspace
  and CR and CR/LF codes. This means that pressing any key will output
  it to the file.

  If, on the other hand, you want to erase the last character entered,
  merely pressing backspace would just echo ascii 8 to the file. By
  depressing SHIFT, backspace will remove the last character, and the
  enter key will echo a CR/LF sequence instead of the plain CR code.
  Also, you can finish typing by pressing SHIFT-CTRL-Z (or
  SHIFT-CTRL-C), so that the ^Z-character isn't written to the file.
  All the characters are shown on the screen using direct video memory
  manipulation, so that the smileys are there too.

อออออออ

  You can copy files to several destinations with a single command. Use a
  colon between all destinations. Example:

  CC *.* D:\BACKUP : A:\

  This will copy all files from the current directory to D:\BACKUP and A:\.
  You can use as many destinations as you want, as long as your OS doesn't
  run out of file handles, as each destination may keep one file open if the
  source file is large enough.

อออออออ

  You can make CCopy run the same command over and over again, by adding a
  double-colon after the command. Example:

  CC A: ::

  This will copy all files from A: to the current directory. After all files
  are copied, you will get a prompt to restart or quit. You can now change
  the diskette in drive A: and press any key to get another copy.

  Note: this can be used with /L to effectively combine files previously
  split with /L.


อออออออออออออออออออัอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
REGISTERED VERSION ณ
อออออออออออออออออออพ

  The registered version has several enhancements over the shareware
  version. The most notable of these is the larger data transfer
  buffer. While the SW-version uses a single file buffer of 48kB, the
  registered version uses all available memory (in DOS version,
  OS/2-version uses only a moderate amount). This naturally improves
  file transfer speeds with large files and you can see the difference
  in Appendix A.

  Another added bonus is the pause-capability. By depressing both shift
  keys for a while, the copying is paused and you are given a choice:
  you can Resume copying, Skip the current file or Abort copying.
  This can be used if you suddenly find that CCopy is copying a large
  file that you didn't want to copy. If copying to disks, it's much
  easier to just pause (with the double shift keys) and choose to Skip
  the file. Any portion that is already copied will be removed.

  The registered version is also capable of logging all events to a log
  file.  This information can be used to build statistics of your copying
  activity and to enable the UNDO utility to cancel the last copy command
  executed.  This feature isn't found in any other file copier in the
  world.

  Registered users also have a configuration utility that will allow
  them to brand different command line options into the executable. And
  don't forget the unlimited free technical support via Internet that
  all registered users have.

  And, most importantly, you will support me and the shareware-concept.
  Only by registering will you encourage me to continue developing this
  program. While it's a good utility as it is, constant development
  ensures that no bugs will remain forever and new features are always
  implemented.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS ณ
อออออออออออออออออออออพ

  You've already seen how to enter command line options on the command
  line in chapter "How to Use CCopy?". Most options can be disabled by
  adding a minus-sign (-) after them and some options behave
  differently when followed by a plus-sign (+). All options are
  explained below with examples and tips on usage.

  Here's a very short list of the few options you might want to try out
  first. They're all pretty simple to use and do what you expect them
  to do.

/A   append   Append source files to destination
/B   beep     Activate sound alarms
/M   move     Move source files
/N   nothing  Write nothing on disks, good for trying out commands
/P   prompt   Ask confirmation for every file
/S   subdirs  Copy subdirectories with directory structure
/?   help     Shows help. Add a letter after it for detailed info.
,mask         Files that match a mask after a comma are not copied

  Here are all the options CCopy understands. They are grouped into
  three categories and sorted alphabetically. If you don't understand
  the effects of a certain option, feel free to ignore it. You can also
  notify me of this shortcoming and I'll try to rectify the situation
  for the next release.

   Below are listed all the options with a detailed description, tips
   on usage and other notes. They are sorted in a good order in which
   you can read and understand them. You can also access these
   descriptions by using CCopy's online help system (type CC/?? for
   instructions).


DISPLAY

/Vx  view      This option controls the information shown on the
                screen during copying. The number after the letter V
                defines screen output, and the choices are:
                0: None. Nothing is shown on the screen.
                1: Brief. Only the file names are shown.
                2: Stats. File names and sizes are shown.
                3: Progress. File names and sizes with progress
                   indicators are shown. (default)
                4: Oneliner. Like 3 but doesn't change the line and
                   the end result looks like 0.
                5: Twoliner. Like 4 but shows source and destination
                   paths during copying.

           TIP: You can use /V4T0 in batch files when you want to see
                the progress indicators but don't want to mess up
                the screen afterwards.

/Tx  totals    This option controls the information shown on the
                screen after copying is finished. The number after the
                letter T defines screen output, and the choices are:
                0: None. Nothing is shown on the screen.
                1: Brief. Number of files copied and skipped with total
                   sizes.
                2: Full. Like 1 but free space, total copying time,
                   copying speed and buffer size are shown.
                3: Extended. Shows amount and total size of source files
                   before copying. (default)

           TIP: /T2 does a free space check after copying, so /T1 may
                be marginally faster when copying to diskettes without any
                kind of disk caching.

/Q   quiet     This option does exactly the same thing as the two
                options /T0 and /V0. This means that nothing is shown
                on the screen during or after the copying, so CCopy
                operates quietly.

           TIP: Use /Q (or /V0T0) in batch files where you want copying
                done invisibly. If, on the other hand, you would like
                to see the progress indicators without leaving any
                traces on the screen, use /V4T0 (or /QV4.

/Q+  quiet     This is a stronger version of /Q. It prevents CCopy from
                displaying anything (like /Q), but will also prevent CCopy
                from asking anything. CCopy will not ask anything under any
                circumstances (excluding the double-shift pause). You can
                force normal output with the /V and /T options if you want.

                If you're appending files, use /A+ if you want CCopy to append
                them as ascii files. Otherwise they will be treated as binaries
                and appended without exception. If you're using zapping, add
                a plus after them to force them. Without a plus they will be
                ignored for security reasons.

           TIP: Use /Q+ when executing CCopy from a batch file or under any
                situation that must not require any input from the user.

/?   help      If you just type CC, you are shown a short list of the
                basic options. CC/? will show the complete list in two
                pages. But CCopy also has an online help system. If you
                want to see the information concerning a certain
                command line option, just add it after the question
                mark. This means that CC/?M will show information on
                the Move-option and CC/?; will tell you how to use the
                include lists. CC/?? shows this text.


SELECTION

/N   nothing   This option is the ultimate safety switch. If you
                insert this on the command line, CCopy is guaranteed to
                do absolutely nothing. This may seem a bit peculiar,
                but what actually happens is that ALL disk writes are
                disabled. This means that no files are created,
                renamed or deleted, no directories are created or
                removed, zapping is disabled and so on.
                CCopy will appear to operate as usual and will still
                read the source files normally, but nothing is ever
                written on any disks.

           TIP: If you're not sure what a certain command will do, add
                /N after it and execute it without worries. Whatever
                CCopy will seem to do is not actually done, so your
                disks are completely safe. This is great for testing
                out some of the more complex commands without any risk.

/R   replace   Use /R to force CCopy to overwrite any files it needs
                to. This is normally not needed as you can simply
                activate this from the first confirmation prompt CCopy
                provides (by choosing the All-option). A minus-sign (-)
                will disable this option.

           TIP: This can be combined with one of the filters (X,U,C,P)
                to produce an automated filtered copy which requires no
                user interaction.

 /R+  replace   This is the stronger version of /R and automatically
                overwrites read-only files. Without this, CCopy will
                issue another confirmation prompt for each read-only
                file it's about to overwrite. This option can also be
                activated from the first read-only confirmation prompt
                (by choosing the All-option).

           TIP: Use one of these in a batch file that you know will
                overwrite potentially read-only files and needs to operate
                on its own, without any interaction with the user.

/K   keep      This is the opposite of /R and will force CCopy to
                automatically skip any files that would overwrite other
                files. This option can also be activated from the first
                overwrite prompt CCopy issues (by choosing the
                Skip-option). A minus-sign (-) will disable this
                option.

           TIP: Use this in a batch file that needs to operate without
                user interaction and must not overwrite any files.

/H   hidden    When you add this option to the command line, CCopy
                will copy all files, including hidden and system files.
                CCopy also retains the files' attributes which means
                that when you copy read-only files the destination file
                will be read-only as well. Without this option the file
                would be changed into a normal file. A minus-sign (-)
                will disable this option.

           TIP: You can use this when copying files from one disk to
                another to ensure that all files are really copied and
                no hidden files are left out.

       WARNING: Be careful when using this with /M, as you can
                accidentally move important system files and cause
                problems to your system.

/X   xisting   This is the simplest filter (X,U,C,P) CCopy knows and
                one of the more useful ones. If this option is
                specified in the command line, CCopy will filter out
                all files that would not overwrite another file were
                they copied. A minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

          NOTE: Filters (X,U,C) only skip certain files. Use /R to
                force automatic operation. You can only have one filter
                in use at a time.

           TIP: Use this to backtrack an accident. If you copy or
                extract several files to a wrong directory which has older
                files, /X is the easiest way to clean that directory.
                Just copy/open the same files to another, empty
                directory and then move the accidental files with /X to
                that directory. Only they are moved and other files are
                left where they are.

/U   update    Update is one of CCopy's filters (X,U,C,P). /U will
                filter out files that would overwrite a file that is
                not older than the source file. This means that CCopy
                will accept only files that don't overwrite other files
                or overwrite files older than themselves. A minus-sign
                (-) will disable this option.

          NOTE: Filters (X,U,C) only skip certain files. Use /R to
                force automatic operation. You can only have one filter
                in use at a time.

           TIP: You can use /U to update programs and backup files. All
                new files are accepted and only those that would
                replace newer files are skipped.

/C   changed   Changed (or freshen) is one of CCopy's filters
                (X,U,C,P). /C will filter out all files that don't
                already exist and also all files that will overwrite a
                file that is not older than the source file. This means
                that CCopy will accept only files that overwrite files
                older than themselves. A minus-sign (-) will disable
                this option.

          NOTE: Filters (X,U,C) only skip certain files. Use /R to
                force automatic operation. You can only have one filter
                in use at a time.

           TIP: /C is good for updating small programs of which you
                keep only some files. When you acquire a newer version,
                just copy the files with /C to the directory where the
                older files are. This way no additional, unneeded files
                are copied.

/P   prompt    Prompt is the interactive filter (X,U,C,P). It will
                force CCopy to issue a confirmation prompt for each
                file copied. With /P you can easily select the files
                you want from a long list of files. The confirmation
                prompt is very versatile and can be automated to
                accept or skip all following files. A minus-sign (-)
                will disable this option.

           TIP: When you want to copy certain files that can't be
                easily selected with source masks, exclude masks,
                letter selection, selection ranges or other filters,
                use /P to do the job. This way you can choose the
                procedure for each file individually.

/1   archive   This is the same as XCopy's /A-option. It copies only
                files with their archive attribute set. A minus-sign
                (-) will disable this option.

/2   archive   This is the same as XCopy's /M-option. It copies only
                files with their acrhive attribute set and removes it
                after a successful copy. A minus-sign (-) will disable
                this option.

/[]  range     Anything found between "/[" and "] " is considered to
                be a 4DOS selection range. There are three types: size,
                date and time. For examples, see chapter "4dos
                features".

,mask          Exclude mask. Any file mask that is preceded by a comma
                (,) is an exclude mask. No path is allowed, only a file
                name mask. If a file matches any specified exclude
                masks it will be ignored. With subdirectory copying all
                exclude masks affect all files in all directories.

           TIP: Use an exclude mask when it's easier to define which
                files NOT to copy, rather than which files should be
                copied.

;mask          Include list. Any file mask that is preceded by a
                semi-colon (;) will be given the same drive and path
                than the mask before it.

           TIP: When you have to copy several individual files from a
                directory, type the path for just the first file and
                use the semi-colon in front of the others.

       WARNING: CCopy uses the last mask as the destination even if
                it's part of an include list. Don't forget the final
                dot (.) when copying several files to the current
                working directory.


MISCELLANEOUS

/4   4DOS      This option activates 4DOS description support. With
                this feature enabled, CCopy checks for a (possibly
                hidden) file named DESCRIPT.ION and reads any comments
                it has and updates them as files are copied. A
                minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

           TIP: If you use this, it's best to add it to your CC alias
                statement so it's on at all times.

/A   append    This option will force CCopy to copy all source files
                one after the other to the destination file. This
                option can't be used with the /M option for security
                reasons. CCopy checks the file for an end-of-file
                character and will prompt you whether or not it should
                be removed before another file is appended to it. For
                text files, removing the EOF-character is recommended.
                A minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

 /A+  append    This will assume that the files are all text files and
                should the EOF-character be found, it will be removed
                automatically.

           TIP: You can also use plus-signs (+) to append files, just
                like in the conventional copier. This method, however
                is much more limited as it cannot handle wildcards. Use
                whichever method you prefer.

/B   beep      This will activate CCopy's sound alarms. Whenever CCopy
                needs you to answer a prompt, a sound alarm will be
                emitted. Another alarm will be sounded when the copying
                is finished. A minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

           TIP: Use this for those copies that take a long time. Then
                you don't have to watch the screen the whole time as
                you can hear when the copying is done or your input is
                required. When copying to multiple disks, this is very
                useful.

/D-  file      Target is a file      \  THESE ARE OBSOLETE AND
                                          SHOULD BE IGNORED
 /D   dir/file  Prompt for file/dir    when target doesn't exist and
                                         multiple files are copied
 /D+  dir       Target is a directory /

/V   verify    This option will turn the DOS verify flag on during
                copying. /V- will in turn disable it.

           TIP: Use this if you don't want to keep the verify flag
                slowing things down at all times but want the security
                active during file copying.

/F   file comp With this option, CCopy will perform a bit-by-bit
                comparison between the source file and the destination
                file to assure that no write errors have occured.
                Smartdrive and compatible disk caches will be flushed
                so that the comparison will be done from the disk, not
                the cache. The DOS verify flag will be activated when
                /F is specified. A minus-sign (-) will disable this
                option.

           TIP: This is useful when copying files to diskettes. Usually
                DOS verify is sufficient, but sometimes you may want to
                make absolutely sure that no errors have occured.

/S   subdirs   If you specify /S, CCopy will copy files from all the
                subdirectories of the source directory as well. Only
                one source flag is accepted for security reasons. The
                directory structure will be built to the destination
                exactly as it originally was. A minus-sign (-) will
                disable this option.

           TIP: Use this to copy large multi-dir programs to another
                location. You can also use /M to move the program. You
                can even copy the whole structure onto multiple disks
                should you want to, although it's not recommended. You
                should rather compress the program into an archive and
                use Cleave (/L) to copy it to the diskettes.

 /S+  subtree   This differs from the normal /S in one aspect: the
                source directory will be created under the destination
                directory rather than just copying the files into the
                destination directory.

           TIP: This option is one of the most useful and powerful
                features CCopy has. With just a single command you can
                move or copy an entire multi-dir program to another
                location without needing a single mkdir or rmdir
                command.

/G   gather    Gathering will scan the directory tree just like /S,
                but it will not recreate the subdirectories to the
                destination. A minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

           TIP: Use this to copy certain files from a directory tree to
                a single directory for easy viewing and/or
                manipulation. /E is also useful in this respect.

/E   extension This option will disable all overwrite prompts.
                Instead, CCopy will rename the original file's
                extension so that the copying will not overwrite any
                files. A minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

           TIP: Use this with the Gather-option to assure that all
                files found are copied and none are overwritten.

/J   jump      This simple little option will, after copying, change
                the current working directory and drive to the
                destination directory. A minus-sign (-) will disable
                this option.

           TIP: Use this whenever you copy files to a directory with a
                long path name and you intend to change to that
                directory right after copying. This will save you a lot
                of work as you have to type the path just once.

/I   ignore    Ignores insufficient free space. In effect this option
                disables the source file scan that CCopy performs before
                copying the files. This will speed up the process by a
                marginal amount (although without any disk caching or on a
                CD-ROM drive the savings can be noticed).

                This will also mean that CCopy cannot show the progress
                indicators, as it doesn't know the total amount of files.
                CCopy will prompt whenever a file doesn't fit on the
                destination drive, but will not prompt if all of the files
                cannot fit - as it doesn't know whether this is the case or
                not.

/L   cleave    The source files will be copied to the destination
                (usually a diskette drive) and when the disk runs out
                of space, you can change the disk and copying will be
                resumed. This will effectively split the large file
                into several chunks that fill their disks completely. A
                minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

                Successive parts of the file will be numbered with digits in
                their extensions.

           TIP: To recombine the chunks, you can proceed in several ways. You
                can simply just append them together one by one (using any
                copier) or you can use /L and combine it with CCopy's loop
                capability (double-colon after the command). Then you merely
                have to switch disks and press any key to append the next
                chunk to the total file.

/M   move      CCopy is a file mover as well as a copier. When you
                specify the Move-option, CCopy will actually move the
                files if it can, instead of just copying them and
                removing the source files afterwards. CCopy sees
                through any substed drives and will move the files if
                they really reside in the same drive.

                When moving files from one drive to another, moving is
                impossible so CCopy will copy them as usual and remove
                the source files after copying them. A minus-sign (-)
                will disable this option.

           TIP: Use /M whenever you need to move files. Most of the
                time you're moving withing a single drive and CCopy can
                move the files at an extremely fast rate.

/O   optimize  As CCopy can automatically copy files to several
                diskettes, it's only natural that CCopy can also do the
                job well. When /O is defined, CCopy will store
                information concerning the source files' sizes to
                memory and when copying, will copy the files in
                descending order of size and continue until the disk
                is absolutely filled as well as possible. Note that
                all source files need to be in the same directory. A
                minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

           TIP: Use /O whenever you're copying several small to medium
                sized files to several diskettes. The difference in
                wasted free space is tremendous.

/Z   zap       Zapper will remove the files from the destination
                before copying the source files. A confirmation prompt
                is always issued with the complete mask that will be
                removed. A minus-sign (-) will disable this option.

           /Z+  No confirmation prompt is issued. DANGEROUS!

           /ZZ  This removes the destination directory with all its
                subdirectories. VERY DANGEROUS!

           /ZZ+ This removes the destination directory with all its
                subdirectories without any confirmation. EXTREMELY
                DANGEROUS!

           /ZZZ This removes the whole destination drive, including all
                subdirectories and files. VERY DANGEROUS!

       WARNING! Zapping is extremely dangerous and careless use can
                easily result in loss of data. Use these only after
                making sure you know what you're doing. Try them with
                the /N option first.

           TIP: Although quite dangerous, these are good for example
                when you want to clean a diskette before copying files
                into it. Note that when you change a disk CCopy will
                reZap the new disk as well.

@comfile       Command file. The file specified after the at-sign (@)
                will be read and processed just like the normal command
                line.

           TIP: This can be useful if you have a list of files you want
                to copy in a file. Just specify the list file after an
                at-sign and its contents (the list of files) is
                processed just as if you had entered it on the command
                line.

=logfile       Log file. The file specified after the equal-sign (=)
                will be opened and all copying activity will be
                appended to it. This information can be used to build
                statistics of your copying activity and to activate the
                Undo program. Only works in the registered version.

           TIP: If you use this, it's best to specify it in an alias or
                batch file so that it's always active.

TIPS AND TECHNIQUES ณ
ออออออออออออออออออออพ

COPYING SEVERAL FILES TO DISKETTES

  Use /O to ensure all disks are filled to maximum capacity. /B is also
  useful to get a sound alarm when you need to change diskettes.

  CC C:\FILES\MISC A: /ob


COPYING LARGE FILES TO DISKETTES:

  If you need to copy a file of several megabytes to diskettes, you can
  use /L to cleave the file neatly to the disks. You might also want to
  use /V or /F to make sure you catch any disk errors during copying.
  /B is always useful when doing long copies. If you're sure you don't
  need any possible contents the disks may have, /ZZ, /ZZ+ or /ZZZ can
  be used as well.

  CC BIGFILE.ZIP A:\ /lfbzz+

  When you need to reassemble the chunks, use /L again. Remember to add the
  double colons after all other parameters so CCopy loops through all the
  disks you provide.

  CC A:BIGFILE.* /lb ::
  CC A:BIGFILE.ZIP /lb ::

  You can also use normal append. Double colons are not necessary, but will
  speed up the process as you don't need to run the program again after
  each disk.

  CC A:BIGFILE.* BIGFILE.ZIP /AB ::


MOVING MULTI-DIR PROGRAMS

  You probably have numerous large programs, like Windows or commercial
  games. These often have subdirectories and copying or moving them can
  be quite difficult. But CCopy is designed to take care of this
  problem as well. /S+ is the option to use here. With large programs,
  it's also good to specify /H so that any hidden files are processed
  as well.

  OK, suppose you have WordPerfect in C:\TOOLS\WP but you'd like to
  move it to C:\TEXTUTIL\WP. With CCopy, you only need one command.

  CC C:\TOOLS\WP C:\TEXTUTIL /hms+

  /S+ is the key element here. It will create a directory called WP
  under the destination directory, thus creating C:\TEXTUTIL\WP. All
  the files will then be moved to that directory and all subdirectories
  will be moved as well. And if you just want to copy the program
  instead of moving it, leave out /M.


COPYING FILES TO A NEW DIRECTORY

  This is extremely easy. If you're copying several files, the
  destination directory will be created if it doesn't exist. When
  copying a single file, it will be copied to another name, but using a
  backslash after the destination will force CCopy to make the directory.

  CC *.* C:\NOTEXIST          - will create the directory
  CC ONEFILE.EXE C:\NOTEXIST  - will copy the file into a file NOTEXIST
  CC ONEFILE.EXE C:\NOTEXIST\ - will create the directory


COPYING EVERYTHING BUT THESE

  Sometimes it's easier to tell which files NOT to copy, instead of the
  files you WANT to copy. For this reason CCopy has exclude masks. The
  following commands are identical to CCopy.

  CC *.*. A: ,*.exe
  CC . ,*.exe a:


ACCIDENTS AND RECOVERY

  Everyone has sometimes made an error. Instead of copying those 50
  files to their proper directory, you've accidentally copied them to
  the wrong drive or wrong directory. Suppose you want to copy the
  files from D:\FILES to C:\FILES.

  D:\FILES>cc *.* C:

  This command is quite dangerous, as you can't be sure of the current
  working directory on drive C. If it's correct (\FILES) then there's
  no problem, but it could just as well be \WINDOWS and then you have
  your files mixed up in C:\WINDOWS. How can you get them out of there?

  D:\FILES>cc C: /MRX

  This simple command will rectify the situation immediately, if the
  working directory on drive C is still \WINDOWS. The command will move
  (/M) all files from C:\WINDOWS back to the directory where you first
  started copying from. It will also replace (/R) all files that do
  exist. And, most importantly, it will copy only those files that
  already exist (/X) in D:\FILES.

  This means that all the files that were in C:\WINDOWS originally will
  still be there but all the mistakenly copied files are removed. After
  this you can do the original copy command, the correct way.

  D:\FILES>cc *.* C:\FILES\


  Another source of misplaced files are file compressors. When opening
  a compressed archive, you can quite easily open the files to the
  wrong directory:

  D:\ZIP>pkunzip -d bigpack.zip C:

  Now, if your working directory of drive C were \WINDOWS, then you
  could have unwanted files AND subdirectories, and lots of them.
  There's really no easy way to remove them, at least, there hasn't
  been before CCopy. You now need two commands to clean up the mess.

  D:\ZIP>pkunzip -d bigpack.zip C:\TESTDIR\
  D:\ZIP>cc C: C:\TESTDIR\ /MRXS

  First, you need to open the archive to the correct place. Then we use
  /X with /M to save the day again. /R will automate the procedure and
  /S is now needed so that the subdirectories are scanned as well.
  CCopy will even remove the extra subdirectories for you, automatically!

4DOS FEATURES ณ
ออออออออออออออพ

  CCopy supports all the features of 4DOS's copy program even if 4dos
  isn't the active command interpreter. For those who do not use 4dos, a
  brief explanation is provided. Note that many of these features are
  more advanced than those of 4dos copy. 4DOS is the registered
  trademark of JP Software Inc.

EXTENDED FILEMASKS:
  Normal DOS interprets *C*.EXE as *.EXE, but 4dos correctly picks out
  the files with the letter 'C' in them.  CCopy does that as well.  The
  OS/2-version also supports long file names as specified by the HPFS.
  The DOS version supports long file names under Windows 95.

EXTENDED COMMAND LINE:
  4DOS can use a command line of up to 255 characters, while DOS only
  127 (OS/2: normal length is 512, 4os2 uses 1024 characters). CCopy can
  read 4dos command lines of any length.

INCLUDE LISTS:
  Starting a mask with a semi-colon (;) adds the directory of the
  previous mask to it.

  CC C:\FILES\*.EXE ;*.COM .

  Will copy all exe- and com-files from c:\files to the current directory.
  You can have extra blanks on either side of the semi-colon whenever you
  want, but you must have one space before the semi-colon.  Even though the
  second mask is an include mask, it will be the destination if it is the
  last mask in the command line.  Thus the last dot at the end defines the
  current working directory as the destination.

LETTER SELECTION:
  With 4dos programs, you can use brackets as letter selectors.

  FILE[123456].EXE
  FILE[1-6].EXE

  Both of these copy files FILE1.EXE,FILE2.EXE...FILE6.EXE. Also,
  letters '?' and '!' can be used. '?' stands for any character and '!'
  for negation.

  FILE[!2].EXE

  This would choose all files matching FILE?.EXE except FILE2.EXE.
  CCopy can also handle letter selections with one improvement: 4dos
  allows '!' only at the beginning of the selection, but CCopy allows
  '!' anywhere. Some examples:

  FILE[1-9!3-6].EXE       (files 1..2 and 7..9)
  FILE[A-Z!G-P!M].EXE     (files A..F, M and Q..Z).

SIZE SELECTION RANGE:
  Accepts only the files whose sizes fall within the range.

  Sizes larger than 50,000 bytes:
  /[s50k]
  /[s50000]

  Sizes larger than 50 kilobytes (51,200 bytes):
  /[s50K]
  /[S50K]

  Sizes between 200 kilobytes and 2 megabytes:
  /[S200K,2M]

  Sizes smaller than 120,000 bytes:
  /[s0,120000]

  Sizes between 100 and 150 bytes: (4dos doesn't allow the last two)
  /[s100,150]
  /[s100,+50]
  /[S150,100]
  /[s150,-50]

TIME SELECTION RANGE:
  Accepts only the files whose time stamps fall within the range.

  Time between 10:00 and current time:
  /[t10:00]
  /[T10:00a]

  Time between 22:00 and current time:

  /[t13:15:20,10:00P]

  Time between two hours ago and one hours ago:
  /[t-120,+60]

DATE SELECTION RANGE:
  Accepts only the files whose date stamps fall within the range.

  Date between 12th October 1994 and today:

APPENDIX A: SPEED COMPARISONS ณ
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออพ

  To back up the claim that CCopy is very fast, several test runs have
  been performed. All results that are listed here are averages of
  several test runs on the same situation. The disk caching program
  used was Smartdrive. Between each test run the cache was restarted so
  that nothing was in the cache prior to the test.

  Notice that CCopy was executed with normal parameters. This means
  that no extra speed was squeezed by /v0 (which disables screen
  output), /t0 (which disables one last free space check from the
  end) or /i (which disables the source file scan before copying).

  The programs tested are:
  COPY      = 4DOS 5.50 copy command
  XCOPY     = PC-DOS 7.0 XCOPY.EXE
  CCOPY SW  = CCopy 1.06 shareware version
  CCOPY REG = CCopy 1.06 registered version

  ONE LARGE FILE, FAST HARD DISK IN A PCI-CONTROLLER
  Copier      No caching   Read cache  Write cache
  COPY       10.38s 100%   9.30s 100%   4.15s 100%
  XCOPY       9.08s  88%   7.66s  82%   3.83s  92%
  CCOPY SW    6.52s  63%   7.00s  75%   4.67s 113%
  CCOPY REG   3.48s  33%   3.90s  42%   3.18s  77%

  Here you see the power of CCopy's large data buffers. As only a
  single file is being copied, there are no speed limits due to
  FAT-updates or small file sizes and the data transfer works at
  maximum speed. CCopy actually works faster without disk caching than
  with one. Read caching only slows it down as all the data is copied
  to the disk cache's memory as well. At best, CCopy is three times as
  fast as the conventional copier.

  100 SMALL FILES, FAST HARD DISK IN A PCI-CONTROLLER
  Copier      No caching   Read cache  Write cache
  COPY       30.78s 100%  17.32s 100%   2.36s 100%
  XCOPY      17.28s  56%  16.59s  96%   2.20s  93%
  CCOPY SW   27.59s  89%  13.40s  77%   2.41s 102%
  CCOPY REG  27.76s  90%  13.40s  77%   2.43s 103%

  With several small files CCopy is at a disadvantage. As it calculates
  the total size of source files prior to copying and checks for free
  space every now and then, it's no wonder it can't perform much better
  than normal copiers. With read caching, CCopy is still significantly
  better.

  ONE LARGE FILE, SLOW HARD DISK IN AN ISA-CONTROLLER
  Copier      No caching   Read cache  Write cache
  COPY       21.07s 100%  20.65s 100%  11.63s 100%
  XCOPY      18.13s  86%  17.85s  86%  10.40s  89%
  CCOPY SW   12.29s  58%  11.95s  58%  11.44s  98%
  CCOPY REG  11.39s  54%  11.15s  54%  10.88s  93%

  Slower hard disks slow down all copiers and with full caching CCopy
  is only marginally faster. With limited caching, however, a notable
  difference in favor of CCopy can be seen.

  100 SMALL FILES, SLOW HARD DISK IN AN ISA-CONTROLLER
  Copier      No caching   Read cache  Write cache
  COPY       42.29s 100%  31.32s 100%   3.34s 100%
  XCOPY      30.78s  73%  30.04s  96%   3.06s  92%
  CCOPY SW   33.36s  79%  20.06s  64%   3.62s 108%
  CCOPY REG  30.94s  73%  19.21s  61%   3.45s 103%

  While small files inhibit CCopy from utilizing its speed to its
  maximum capacity, a slow hard disk slows other programs down even
  more. Without caching CCopy works almost as fast as with a faster
  hard disk (see above) and with read caching is quite better than copy
  or xcopy.

  Controlled Copy is a copyrighted computer program which is being
  marketed as shareware.  It is not a public domain program, and it is
  not free.

  Shareware is a marketing method, not a type of software.  It gives
  users a legal but limited trial period to evaluate a program before
  purchase.  If you continue to use the program after the trial period
  has ended, you must register (pay for) the program.  It's that simple.

  Shareware is produced by accomplished programmers, just like retail
  software.  There is good shareware and bad shareware, just as there is
  good and bad retail software.  The primary difference between
  shareware and retail software is that with shareware you know if it's
  good or bad BEFORE you pay for it.

  Shareware benefits you, the software user, because you get to try the
  software on your own system, within your own special work environment,
  and determine whether it meets your needs before you pay for it.  And
  shareware benefits program authors because we are able to get our
  products into your hands without the hundreds of thousands of dollars
  in expenses it takes to launch a traditional software product.  There
  are many programs on the market today which would never have become
  available without the shareware marketing method.

  The shareware system and the continued availability of quality
  shareware products depend on your willingness to register and pay for
  the shareware you use.  It's the registration fees you pay that allow
  us to support and continue to develop our products.

  Please show your support for shareware by registering those programs
  you actually use and by passing them on to others.

  Shareware is kept alive by YOUR support!
